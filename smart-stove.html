      <h2 id="welcome">Smart Kitchen Stove</h2>

<p>The idea behind the product is to create a smart and safe kitchen stove. As you can see in the doodle, the smart stove contains different sensors and indicator to make cooking experience more safe.</p>

<h3 id="little-background-about-me">Working</h3>

<p>
1) LED Light Array: There is an array of LED Light on top of the stove chimney, which indicate if the stove is in use or not. The LED light are Green when stove in normal use, Red when stove in ON and left unattended, and flashes RED light continues when it detects heavy smoke

2) Smoke Sensor: There are smoke sensors which depending on intensity of smoke can switch OFF the heating for safety.

3) Weight Sensor: There are weight sensor placed under the heating coil, this weight sensor can be used to weight amount of food in utensil so that the smart stove can adjust the required heat appropriately to save energy. Other use of weight sensor is that if the stove coil is empty or if the utensil is empty(has mechanism to calibrate utensil weight) the heating won't start to prevent any fire hazard.

4) Light Sensor(placed above LED screen): Used to detects if the stove is left unattended which would cause the LED array to change color to red.

5) Safety Dial: Provide with two setting for cooking 
 	a) Safe : All the sensor are active and heat is adjusted for saving energy.
 	b) High : Only light and smoke sensor are active. Required for cooking food which require high heat. But if the stove is left unattended or if the smoke is above certain higher limit heat would be stopped.

6) LED Display: This is a touch screen display which can display current cooking stats like weight, power consumptions. Can also be used to display recipes or watching Youtube videos.  

7) Camera: Can be used to keep track of all the ingridents the user has added to the food and display it not the screen.  

</p> 

<h3 id="little-background-about-me">Testing and Audience</h3>
<p>
Can be used in apartments or restaurants but primary audience would be apartments because generally restaurants required high heat.
</p> 

<h3 id="little-background-about-me">Performance</h3>
<p>
The performance can be decided by the total energy saving or by the reduction in the number of times fire alarm in the apartment got activated.
